* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.

## Pull Requests
* If you are interested in helping out, issues tagged as [recommended for beginners](https://github.com/DemocracyClub/UK-Polling-Stations/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22recommended+for+beginners%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/DemocracyClub/UK-Polling-Stations/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are the best place to start.

     * `pytest --flakes` (lint with pyflakes)
     * `black .` (auto-format with black)
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository.
