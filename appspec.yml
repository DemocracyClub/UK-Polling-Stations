# During the Install deployment lifecycle event (which occurs between the
#   BeforeInstall and AfterInstall events), copy the specified files
#   in "source" starting from the root of the revision's file bundle
#   to "destination" on the Amazon EC2 instance.
# Specify multiple "source" and "destination" pairs if you want to copy
#   from multiple sources or to multiple destinations.
# If you are not copying any files to the Amazon EC2 instance, then remove the
#   "files" section altogether. A blank or incomplete "files" section
#   may cause associated deployments to fail.
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /var/www/polling_stations/code/

# For deployments to Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, or RHEL instances,
#   you can specify a "permissions"
#   section here that describes special permissions to apply to the files
#   in the "files" section as they are being copied over to
#   the Amazon EC2 instance.
#   For more information, see the documentation.
# If you are deploying to Windows Server instances,
#   then remove the
#   "permissions" section altogether. A blank or incomplete "permissions"
#   section may cause associated deployments to fail.
permissions:
  - object: /var/www/polling_stations/code
    pattern: "**"
    owner: polling_stations
    group: polling_stations
    mode: 755

# If you are not running any commands on the Amazon EC2 instance, then remove
#   the "hooks" section altogether. A blank or incomplete "hooks" section
#   may cause associated deployments to fail.
hooks:
# For each deployment lifecycle event, specify multiple "location" entries
#   if you want to run multiple scripts during that event.
# You can specify "timeout" as the number of seconds to wait until failing the deployment
#   if the specified scripts do not run within the specified time limit for the
#   specified event. For example, 900 seconds is 15 minutes. If not specified,
#   the default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
#   Note that the maximum amount of time that all scripts must finish executing
#   for each individual deployment lifecycle event is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
#   Otherwise, the deployment will stop and CodeDeploy will consider the deployment
#   to have failed to the Amazon EC2 instance. Make sure that the total number of seconds
#   that are specified in "timeout" for all scripts in each individual deployment
#   lifecycle event does not exceed a combined 3600 seconds (1 hour).
# For deployments to Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, or RHEL instances,
#   you can specify "runas" in an event to
#   run as the specified user. For more information, see the documentation.
#   If you are deploying to Windows Server instances,
#   remove "runas" altogether.
# If you do not want to run any commands during a particular deployment
#   lifecycle event, remove that event declaration altogether. Blank or
#   incomplete event declarations may cause associated deployments to fail.
# During the ApplicationStop deployment lifecycle event, run the commands
#   in the script specified in "location" starting from the root of the
#   revision's file bundle.
# During the BeforeInstall deployment lifecycle event, run the commands
#   in the script specified in "location".
