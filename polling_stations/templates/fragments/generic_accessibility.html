                Every polling station will have a wheelchair accessible polling booth.
                Pencils, magnifiers and large print ballot papers will be available.
                You can take your phone into the polling booth to use a magnifier or text-to-speech app.
                There will be a place to sit, if needed.

                If you need help to complete your ballot paper, you can ask a member of staff at the station.
                You can also take a friend or relative to the polling station to help you.
                However, there are different rules for this depending on the election type and which UK nation
                live in. Visit the <a href="{{ ec_url }}">{{  electoral_commission_website }}</a> for further information.
