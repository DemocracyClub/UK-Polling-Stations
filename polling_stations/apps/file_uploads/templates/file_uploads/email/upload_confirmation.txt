Thank you for providing polling station data to Democracy Club's polling station finder: https://wheredoivote.co.uk/uploads/login.

We aim to have all data added to the finder within two weeks of it being supplied, but please be aware that this only an estimate and is dependant on demand.

We will be in touch if we have any questions about your data, and will email to let you know when it is live.

In the event that a station location changes after this date, please alert us by contacting pollingstations@democracyclub.org.uk.

Kind Regards
The Democracy Club Team
