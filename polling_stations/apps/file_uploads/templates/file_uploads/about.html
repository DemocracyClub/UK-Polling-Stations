    <h3>Uploading Data</h3>

    <p>
        Welcome to Democracy Club’s new polling station uploader tool! We hope this will streamline the process for providing your lists of polling places to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information on how to create the necessary file can be found <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/projects/polling-stations/upload/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each time you log in you will need to create a new 'magic link', as long as you use your council email this
        should automatically match you to your council.
        If you are responsible for elections in more than one council area, please contact us, and we can assign extra
        councils to your account
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions please <a href="mailto:pollingstations@democracyclub.org.uk">get in touch</a>.

    <h3>About the Polling Station Finder</h3>

    <p>
        Democracy Club’s <a href="https://wheredoivote.co.uk/">WhereDoIVote.co.uk</a> allows voters to find their assigned
        polling station using nothing more than a postcode.
        The data you provide also powers the postcode look-up on <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter">
            The Electoral Commission</a> voter pages,
        and is available for other organisations to use, free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add our <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/projects/polling-stations/embed/">
            polling station widget</a> to your own website for free.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have uploaded your data, our developers check the file for problems and import it into the finder. Once the data is live on the site, we will contact you to let you know using the email address used to upload the file.
        All data is removed immediately after the election it is assigned to is over. We always err on the side of caution, and will not display information if we are at all unsure about it.
        Please note the finder does not at present cover town and parish elections, or other forms of local polls (eg. planning referendums).
